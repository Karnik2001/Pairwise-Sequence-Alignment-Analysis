# Pairwise-Sequence-Alignment-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates pairwise sequence alignment using the Biopython library in Python. Sequence alignment is a fundamental technique in bioinformatics that helps compare DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify regions of similarity and functional relationships.

In this project, I implemented global and local sequence alignments with different scoring parameters, gap penalties, and alignment methods.

## 🔧 Features

Global alignment (globalxx, globalms)

Local alignment (localxx)

Custom scoring functions (match/mismatch, gap penalties)

Alignment visualization in a human-readable format

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x
Biopython (pairwise2 module)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Applied Biopython to solve sequence alignment problems.

Strengthened Python programming and bioinformatics skills.

Gained exposure to computational biology concepts.
